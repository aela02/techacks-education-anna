Welcome to Anna Alava's Hackathon Project for Education
=================

What inspired me to create this project?

From working with young children as a Kumon tutor, I became familiarized with the general reading comprehension levels of 3-7 year olds. When Kumon sessions went virtual because of Covid, there were a lot of difficulties because students had trouble navigating written instructions to get on to Zoom when they were coming to learn how to read in the first place.

Now as schools also switch to online learning with platforms such as Google Classroom and Zoom, these solutions leave young children behind.

Many parents have taken to Twitter to show their 4-6 year olds who struggle to read all their instructions, navigate Zoom's meeting IDs, or simply sit still.

I wanted to make a platform that made online school simple for children who can't read yet, without the need for their parents to help.

So, I made this site: K-1 Classroom.

In addition to basic words, it's filled with intuitive pictures. 

To remedy the compicated Zoom issue, I've embedded Zoom onto the website with a custom url, so that all the student has to do is type in their name and join, without entering a meeting ID. 

This website has places for polling and feedback, so students can communicate with the teacher if Zoom still isn't working.

If a child's parent doesn't want them to be on the internet, the book, music, and games sections give them a safe, curated place to access resources.
