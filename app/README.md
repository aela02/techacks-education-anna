Welcome to Anna Alava's Hackathon Project for Education
=================

What inspired me to create this project?

As the US switches to online learning with platforms such as Google Classroom and Zoom, I noticed that these solutions left young children behind.

Parents took to Twitter to show their 4-6 year olds who struggled to read all their instructions, navigate Zoom's meeting IDs, or simply sit still.

I wanted to make a platform that made online school simple for children who can't read yet, without the need for their parents to help.

So, I made this site: [Insert your teacher's name here] Classroom, where everyone can see the pictures.

In addition to basic words, it's filled with intuitive pictures. 

To remedy the compicated Zoom issue, I've embedded Zoom onto the website with a custom url, so that all the student has to do is type in their name and join, without entering a meeting ID. 

This website has places for polling and feedback, so students can vote on their favorite books for next week's story time.

If a child's parent doesn't want them to be on the internet, the book section gives them a safe, curated place to access books on youtube.
